# Somil Gupta

Hey, I'm a Founding Member at [Telematica](https://telematica.so) and Welcome! to my digital garden.

I'm a full-time Backend + veteran VUI Developer
Passionate about EVs, Voice Technology, Web Apps, Serverless Architecture and Vanilla JS :)

In my spare time, the development community is a big part of my life. 

I spend much time learning emerging technologies and actively figuring out venues that would help me integrate this cutting-edge technology into consumer and enterprise products.
