# Somil Gupta

Hello there, traveller of the web. Welcome to my digital garden!

![Digital Garden](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cxdHyal-gX6AzsZLXMVI3w.png)

I'm Somil, founding Member at [Telematica](https://telematica.so).

A full-time Backend + veteran VUI Developer
Passionate about EVs, Voice Technology, Web Apps, Serverless Architecture and Vanilla JS :)

In my spare time, the development community is a big part of my life. 

I spend much time learning emerging technologies and actively figuring out venues that would help me integrate this cutting-edge technology into consumer and enterprise products.

Apart from working, I also love to travel and explore new places. And I am really passionate about cycling.
