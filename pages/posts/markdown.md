## Blockquotes

Hey guys, let's jot something down.

So I recently started solo travelling and thought of blogging something related to my travel adventure and experience.

As a complete beginner, I didn't know where to start and what to write precisely. Then while googling the same, I saw this two-word answer to my query :)

>True Story.

And then this quote happened, which gave me the motivational boost that was needed.

So here we go...
I started my solo trip from [Zostel Kodaikanal](https://www.zostel.com/zostel/kodaikanal); let's do a tiny sneak peek.

Isn't it amazing! like it's calling you to visit it :) It was long on my bucket list, so I finally decided to visit this time.
I booked a week's stay in Zostel and just went there with minimal expectations. As I was on a "workcation", my routine was to work in the daytime (with small breaks for bonding with people and chai) and chill with everyone at night.

I stayed there for one week and met many new people with professions varying from physiotherapist to corporate lawyer (me being a software engineer). Almost everyone was travelling solo, which motivated me to make more such solo trips.

I bonded very well with a lot of them, did a lot of fun activities, played a lot of board games and even tried solving a 500 pieces puzzle (We couldn't be able to complete it)://

I learned a lot of lessons about solo travelling and travelling in general.
Finger crossed for more such trips :)

Bye-bye for now.
